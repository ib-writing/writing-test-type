                                A blog is a conversation. Try to write the way you speak. Avoid jargon and clichés and
                                don't overuse the thesaurus. It may be helpful to speak your entry out loud before
                                trying to type it or to read it aloud after you've written it. If you find yourself
                                struggling as you read aloud or speaking unnaturally, think about what you might have
                                said if you were talking to a friend rather than writing

                        <p>A 'social media posting / online forum' will be appropriate if the task requires you to join
                            in and contribute to an online discussion of some sort. This will mean that you make a
                            public statement of what you think to a fairly undefined audience (or at least, people that
                            you don't know personally) - and the task is likely to specify that you are responding to
                            earlier statements in the forum, either for or against.

                            ... 'blog' or '(informal) email / letter '... a 'blog' is an online statement, but it is
                            essentially your own personal magazine - you decide to select and present some of your
                            personal ideas in a lively entertaining way to a general, undefined audience. You want to
                            entertain, and hook your (unknown) audience by your interesting, even provocative, opinions
                            and experiences. An '(informal) email / letter' is not a public form of statement: it is
                            intended to communicate some personal experiences, thoughts and feelings to somebody you
                            know. This sort of writing is public only in the sense that you are having a conversation
                            limited to a friend - it is a private form of sharing.
